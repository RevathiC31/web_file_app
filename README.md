# Flask Web Application
## Description
A Flask-based web application for user registration, authentication, and secure file management.
## Features
* User registration and login with hashed passwords
* File upload, download, view, and delete functionality
* User-specific file access control
* SQLite database integration using SQLAlchemy
* Flash messaging for user feedback
* MIME type detection for file viewing
## Technologies Used
* Flask – Web framework
* SQLAlchemy – ORM for database interaction
* Werkzeug – Password hashing and secure file handling
* OS & mimetypes – File system and MIME type support
## Installation
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/RevathiC31/web_file_app.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Werkzeug
3. Run the application: python app.py
## Usage
* Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.
* Register a new user or log in.
* Upload, view, download, or delete your files securely.
*  site.db
  Purpose: This is the SQLite database file used by your Flask application.
  What it stores:
  User credentials (username and hashed password)
  Metadata about uploaded files (filename, path, user ID)
  How it's created: Automatically generated by SQLAlchemy when you run db.create_all() in your app.py.
  Why it's important: It allows persistent storage of user and file data without needing a separate database server.
* uploads/
  Purpose: This folder stores all the files uploaded by users.
  How it works:
  When a user uploads a file, it's saved here using a secure filename.
  The file path is stored in the database (site.db) for retrieval.
  Security Note: Ensure this folder is protected from unauthorized access in production (e.g., by validating file types and using access controls).
